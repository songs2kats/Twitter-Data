2638,2020-02-22 08:53:57+00:00,Not sure how. 11 countries in the world didn't have a recession. All of the ones that did were hit with a similar timeline and the UK avoided a double dip. Blaming one guy for a recession that started in another country and affected the whole world is a reach.
2639,2020-02-22 08:37:05+00:00,The German government has a lot more room to bail out their banks than the UK government did in 2008. And a lot more room for fiscal expansion to combat a recession.
2640,2020-02-22 08:28:22+00:00,It is true that some EZ economies are in a precarious position. However UK trade isn’t worth nearly as much to EU trade as vice versa. EU27 voters are largely v pro-EU and v unlikely even any recession would be blamed on failure of Brexit negotiations to any meaningful degree.

2647,2020-02-21 19:23:40+00:00,Yes. There's no doubt that failing to agree an FTA would significantly hurt both sides. And invoking a recession in our closest trading partners would be an amazingly careless way for the UK government to pile misery on top of misery for the British people.
2648,2020-02-21 19:21:40+00:00,"Whatever the economy does, the UK will still save on the EU Budget Contribution. Germany is going into recession while in the EU."

3088,2020-02-02 01:26:21+00:00,First crash DID come immediately after the vote. Only careful management by Mark Carney & BoE prevented recession. As it is the £ has still tanked against € &amp; $plus the UK has fallen in world standings - and it has only just begun... Not forgetting we are now a divided nation

Given that Germany is in technical recession and France is suffering serious civil unrest I can only imagine how French workers will react when the UK stares we will exit on WTO terms causing huge job losses."

3096,2020-02-01 19:59:51+00:00,"Ok, here's one for ya: What if the global economy slips into a recession BEFORE the independence referendum? The EU is living on the edge of a knife, so if things look worse in the EU would Scotland be more likely to vote remain and take their chances with the UK?"

There's more likelihood of a eurozone recession occuring as opposed to a UK one.
3100,2020-02-01 18:41:08+00:00,Selective reporting. UK is also on the brink of recession. I'm afraid the idea that the EU will collapse without us is fanciful nonsense.
